Elements of the application:

In the front:
1- Dash board of pollution in madrid, customizable to a point, maybe a neigborhood.
2- webpage explaining the process to make the former calculation
3- Analysis, with several dashboards, of the pollution in madrid

In the back:
1- Server from DigitalOcean asking as client for the new data of pollution (monthly) and weather(daily).
2- Algorithm to make the calculation
3- Connection to tableau to show the dashboard
4- Connection to carto to make the iamges.

In the mathematics
1- Modelling the evolution of the pollution in the stations to predict its behaviour for a whole month, maybe an ARIMA model
2- Modelling the pollution in every point taking into account the weather, the proximity to streets, the nature of the day 
(day of the week, vacation time, holyday, etc...). This will be quit challenging:


The data:
- For the pollution in MAdrid should access:
https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=aecb88a7e2b73410VgnVCM2000000c205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD

- Maybe, the dayli data could came from:
https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=f3c0f7d512273410VgnVCM2000000c205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default


- Portal of the major showing the same it is mean to be done here:

- The info about the weather could came from:
