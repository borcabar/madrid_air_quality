The whole wortk to make a web-application to calculate the pollution in any point of Madrid

I mean to take the public information of pollutant's concetration in the air of Madrid delivered by the enviromental stations, 
cross this information with the weather info and the days of the week, to estimate the pollution's level's in any point of Madrid's city.

Expect to make a web-application where people access a dasboard updated every-day, feed the address they wish (inside the Madrid area), 
and get an estimation of the pollutants in the point for the next few days.

Add a dashboard showing explaining the methodology, including a time-series analysis (very likely) with an ARIMA model.

That's all!
